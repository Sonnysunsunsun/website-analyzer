# How We Built SiteAnalyzer Pro

## The Idea
Small businesses needed a way to understand how their website performs without expensive consultants or complex tools. We wanted to build something that gives instant, actionable feedback.

## Process

### 1. PRD Creation with AI
- Used ChatGPT to brainstorm and structure our ideas
- Built a full Product Requirements Document in about 6 hours
- AI helped us think through features, user flows, and technical requirements

### 2. Prototyping with Claude Code
- Sent the PRD to Claude Code (AI coding assistant)
- Built the entire prototype in 48 hours
- Claude Code wrote the backend (Node.js/Express), frontend (HTML/CSS/JS), database setup, and API integrations
- Zero manual coding - all AI-assisted

### 3. Feedback from Classmates & Professors
**What they liked:**
- Instant results (30 seconds vs days)
- Plain English explanations
- Real examples from their actual website

**What they didn't like:**
- Subscription pricing ($49-199/month) felt too high for one-time use
- Wanted more technical details and code examples

### 4. Business Model Pivot
**Changed from:** Monthly subscription model
**Changed to:**
- Free unlimited analysis (monetized with ads/affiliates)
- $9.99 one-time payment for detailed 20+ page PDF report

**Why:** Lower barrier to entry, easier conversion, better user experience

## Tools Used
- **ChatGPT**: PRD creation, brainstorming
- **Claude Code**: Full development (backend, frontend, database)
- **Claude AI**: Website content analysis
- **Vercel**: Deployment and hosting
- **Puppeteer**: Website rendering and analysis

## Key Stats
- **Build time**: 48 hours
- **Development cost**: ~$20 in AI API fees
- **Code written**: 2,500+ lines (all by AI)
- **Iterations**: 3 major versions based on feedback

## Lessons Learned
1. **AI accelerates execution** - What would take weeks took 2 days
2. **Get feedback fast** - We shared within 24 hours and learned what to fix
3. **Be willing to pivot** - Changed entire business model based on user input
4. **Focus on value, not tech** - Users care about results, not how you built it

## The Big Takeaway
With AI tools like Claude Code, anyone can build software prototypes quickly. The hard part isn't coding anymore - it's understanding your users, validating assumptions, and iterating based on feedback.
